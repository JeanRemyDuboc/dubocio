# What I'm up to right now
## Inspired by [Derek Siver's "Now Page" idea](https://nownownow.com/)

Now, I'm an analytics manager for [Mary's Meals](https://www.marysmeals.org/), a charity that tackles world hunger using a simple idea.  
By setting up school feeding programmes in partnership with some of the world's poorest communities, Mary’s Meals helps to encourage children into the classroom – and gives them the energy to concentrate on lessons – so they can gain an education that can help them work towards a brighter future. 
We serve more than 2 million children every school day in the most deprive areas in the workd ([see where we work](https://www.marysmeals.org/what-we-do/where-we-work)). **It only takes £19.15 to feed a child in a place of education for a whole school year**. 

Please consider [becoming a regular giver](https://www.marysmeals.org/get-involved/donate/become-a-regular-giver) if you can.

Because that doesn't keep me busy enough (ha!), I also:
- lead a small debt advice charity called [CMA Connect Fareham](https://cmaconnectfareham.org/).
- raise money money for Mary's Meals through sports. I'm training for the [Winchester Half Marathon](https://www.winchesterhalf.co.uk/) in September. I'm also planning to sign up for a [Spartan Race](https://www.spartan.com/) later on. 
- Co-host the [Erreur 200 Podcast](https://erreur200.com/) with my friend [David](https://thedaviddias.com/). Erreur 200 French-speaking podcast about web development. We're on a hiatus for the moment, since [David is writing a book](https://thedaviddias.substack.com/p/im-writing-a-book), but we will back soon.
- Playing music at my local church, and teaching myself piano and learning how to use [partial capos](https://partialcapo.com/) on my guitar.
