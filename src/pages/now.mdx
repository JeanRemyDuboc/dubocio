## What I'm up to right now
### Inspired by [Derek Siver's "Now Page" idea](https://nownownow.com/)

Currently I'm:
- Working for [Mary's Meals](https://www.marysmealsusa.org) as Data Insight Manager
- Improving my knowledge of BI and analytics tools: Power BI and DAX, Python, and getting better at SQL
- Learning more about server-side tagging
- Leading [a local debt advice charity](https://cmaconnectfareham.org/), with a wonderful team of volunteers
- Teaching myself piano and learning how to use [partial capos](https://partialcapo.com/) on the guitar
- Training for a half marathon for Mary's Meals, and running at my local [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) regularly
