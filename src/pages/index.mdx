## Hi, I'm Jean-RÃ©my

It's pronounced Jan-Rey-Mee, but you can call me JR. 
I'm a web developer turned researcher turned analytics nerd.

Here's what I love doing:
- Using technology (especially the web), to make the world a little better. Sounds idealistic, I know, but I really believe tech can improve people's lives. 
- Using data to help organisations serve their people (ie. your users, customers, employees, etc.) Anyone who matters to you deserves to be understood and served. If that's not what you use your data for, why do data at all?

I get to do all of this as an analytics manager for [Mary's Meals](https://www.marysmeals.org/), a charity that tackles world hunger using a simple idea ([learn more about what we do](https://www.marysmeals.org/what-we-do)).
