## Hi, I'm Jean-RÃ©my

It's pronounced Jan-Rey-Mee, but you can call me JR. I'm an analytics engineers with more than 10 years experience in multiple industries.

This site is my way to help web developers work with data, and provide value for their colleagues and clients: 
  
- Collect data on your app with tagging and tag management tools such as Google Tag Manager,
- Analyse your data and build reports in Google Analytics, SalesForce or PowerBi,
- Get deeper insights with advanced visualisations, machine learning and AI
