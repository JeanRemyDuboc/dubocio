## The Story so Far

I started my career as a front-end and [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) developer (remember Flash? Good times...). Then I discovered GNU/Linux and fell into the open source dev rabbit hole.  

I worked as a freelance while studying business and computer science. Then I moved to the UK and built eLearning systems for the [School of Medicine in Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/faculty-of-medicine). From there, I ended up doing research into ontologies and the semantic web for virtual patients. Somehow, that earned me a PhD in [Web Science from the University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/web-science-institute).

Since then, I've been a happy full-stack developer and web analytics expert, working in many industries (insurance, marketing agencies, the cosmetics industry at the [Est√©e Lauder Companies](https://www.elcompanies.com), etc.).
