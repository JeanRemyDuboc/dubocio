## What I'm up to right now
### Inspired by [Derek Siver's "Now Page" idea](https://nownownow.com)

Currently I'm:

- Working for [Mary's Meals](https://www.marysmealsusa.org) as Data Insight Manager
- Improving my knowledge of BI and analytics tools: Power BI and DAX, Python, and getting better at SQL
- Learning more about server-side tagging
- Leading [CMA Connect Fareham](https://cmaconnectfareham.org/), a local debt advice charity with a wonderful team of volunteers
- Teaching myself piano and learning how to use [partial capos](https://partialcapo.com/) on the guitar
- Working out to improve my performance at Parkrun and prepare for a 10 mile race for Mary's Meals
